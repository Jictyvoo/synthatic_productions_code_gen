# Thenafter - Dart

The dart implementation of `thenafter`, a library that parses **BNF** `.grm` file and produces the first and follow sets.
This implementation also generated synthatic functions from the grammar.

## Getting Started

Import this library in your project, load file contents as you wish, then send a Iterable<int> to `BNFParser`

## Future plans

As this lib was build in dart, and don't use any additional dependencies, in the future is planned to publish this lib in JS compiled from dart code
